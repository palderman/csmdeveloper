- Update package documentation to meet CRAN requirements
- Add helper functions to run simulations
    - Add as an additional output type for csm_render_model()?
        - maybe: csm_render_model(..., output_type = "deSolve_simulator", ...)
        - maybe: csm_render_model(..., output_type = "deSolve_integrator", ...)
    - Add check for parameter order
- Probably for later package version: Come up with some way to implicitly
  add time-specific intermediate variables for use in equations of
  transformed/state variables
