- Next time split csm_create_dydt() into csm_create_model() and csm_render_model()
- Implement csm_create_data()
    - definition of datasets
    - time-variant vs time-invariant
    - other descriptors of datasets

- Probably for later package version: Come up with some way to implicitly add time-specific intermediate
  variables for use in equations of transformed/state variables
